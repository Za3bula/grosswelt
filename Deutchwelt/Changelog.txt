Map:
	Map is as you can see it in terms of what nations own what (not listing this)
	Alsace-Lorraine is 40 LR
	Gave Bozen (South Tirol) to Tirol
	Brest reduced from it's normal size to the 3 parts of it that PLC owns at the start + Suwalki from Mazowieckie
	Merged Bremen and Oldenburg
	Merged Brunswick with Detmold
	Merged Holstein with Hamburg
	Merged Mecklenburg with Lubeck
	Blue Bordered all outside of the countries on the map, also blue-bordered 2 states of UK which are no longer ports (can no longer build ships in Wales and NW-England nor Bristol+Bath)
	Small state rework with Sweden to remove the 2 1 province states
	
Pop Changes:
	Changed all Lithuanians into Polish (VERY SMALL AMOUNT)
	
PopTypes Changes:
	Removed anyone's demand for Opium

Reno Changes:
	I've compressed Reno changes down so they're easily portable now, with pretty vanilla values in places, with the localisation folder trimmed down to not have extra bloat and simply just have the pure Reno changes, some had to be manually added however

-----------------------------------VERSION 0.2 ----------------------------------
Misc:
	Austria's lit is at 45% over 40% now
	Frankfurt merged into Nassau
	Sikkim is added with host decisions
	Invisible event to add 100k to all GPs, and 50k to all secondaries day1 (this event is on Sikkim)
	Blue-bordered Sikkim

Life needs:
Fruit -> Grain - this causes an 'overflow' of grain which can then be used to fill in the other 'luxury' goods
Cattle is over demand, fine
Fish is over demand, fine
Vanilla has all 3 goods in too low a supply to funnel into the economy
Due to the lack of luxuries and those needed to be added in, fruit was decided to be removed, as it reduces the amount of adjustments needed for the remaining life needs (AKA the most important thing to keep balanced) as these can easily get occupied and fuck up supply, so just less chance of mass starvation is the point. Can always increase demand in the worst case minorly
Wool - massively increased production
Replaced fish in - 285 (Chester), 539 (Bremen)
Replaced grain in - 528 (Hamburg), 529 (Lauenburg), 596 (Aschaffenburg), 556 (Halle), 613 (Salzburg), 735 (Bozen)

Important goods (includes everyday):
Cotton - Added a LOT of cotton - 621 (Krems), 719 (Bialystock), 937 (Brest-Litovsk), 936 (Gordno), 707 (Suwalki), 711 (Siedlice), 706 (Warsaw), 708 (Plock), 696 (Allenstem), 697 (Gumbinnen), 599 (Munich), 600 (Landshut), 592 (Augsburg), 593 (Ulm), 630 (Budejovice), 595 (Nuremberg), 589 (Stuttgart)
Halved consumption.
This has drastically increased the cotton production, it seems to be in line with vanilla demand now (lots of countries, including Bavaria, the 2nd biggest producer, do NOT start with piston steam engine). If there is too little provinces of these cannot be increased, as it would interfere with the other RGOs and not be as 'consolidated' then i.e. the provinces would be everywhere as opposed to now where they sprawl on connected tiles from around Munich or all around Lomza
Lumber - Outside of Russia there isn't much Lumber in Europe - 715 (Lublin), 709 (Lomza), 679 (Kolberg), 680 (Koslin)
Testing is needed same as above but is far better as demand only seems to be slightly below, doubt this will need anymore adjustments.

'Luxury' goods:
Dye - 100k in France already, just need a smaller province to be filled in - 536 (Brunswick)
Tropical Wood - Removed
Rubber - Removed
Silk - Removed
Oil - Spawns in 334 (Malmo), 280 (Newcastle), and 544 (Schwerin) at 1870
Tobacco - Crazy high demand, will have a few but will knock down consumption - 329 (Goteborg), 367 (Aalborg), 310 (Christianssand), 372 (Copenhagen), 281 (Hull), 278 (Manchester), 277 (Liverpool), 376 (Rotterdam)
Halved Consumption
Coffee, Tea - Removed
Opium - Added in all of the following low pop provinces - 585 (Detmold), 564 (Frankfurt), 614 (Bregenz), 594 (Sigmaringen), 608 (Neuchatel), 380 (Breda), 693 (Elbing), 371 (Aabenraa)

Industrial RGOs:
All 3 major RGOs, coal, iron, & sulphur have fine production, it is Europe after all with Russia cut out - no issues

Gold:
Intially just 1 in France (Alsace-Lorraine) 
This causes a drastic decrease in the world economy immediately, add gold mines to all major nations in the game (Pru-Aus-Fra-Eng)
Gold in - 624 (Eisenstadt), 689 (Tesin), 552 (Cottbus), 303 (Southampton), 621 (Krems), 386 (Assen), 313 (Christiania), 396 (Spa)
The top 4 GPs get 1 (or 2 in the case of Austria) goldmine = 80k - for both Prussia and England this is in their capital state (Brandenburg and SE-England), for France this is its vanilla location in Alsace Lorraine, for Austria this is 50k in its capital, 30k in Tesin (Moravia)
The 3 'lesser' GPs of Netherlands, Belgium, and Sweden get a 20k, 35k, and a 27k representfully
Tested game with this, over all money increases day 1, only decreasing due to debts, this can be avoided by giving every country 100k to start with
